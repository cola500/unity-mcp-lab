# Debug logging

CampfireVR writes timestamped, structured events to a local file on every Quest run. The goal is to reconstruct a two-headset test session after the fact by diffing log files from both devices.

## What gets logged

| Event | When | Useful for |
|---|---|---|
| `app_started` | First frame after launch | Per-session header — product name, version, platform, device model, install mode |
| `network_bootstrap_ready` | NetworkBootstrap.Start() | Initial mode, room letter, active scene |
| `editor_key` | Editor key press (H/C/X/M/L) | Repro paths when iterating in flat-screen Editor |
| `mode_changed` | Y press / M key | LAN ↔ Relay toggle |
| `room_changed` | Right thumbstick cycles letter | Off-default room selection |
| `recenter` | A press | View recenter request |
| `host_pressed` / `join_pressed` | X / B press | User intent capture |
| `lan_host_attempt` / `lan_host_ready` / `lan_host_failed` | LAN host flow | Same-Wi-Fi diagnostics |
| `lan_join_attempt` / `lan_join_started` / `lan_join_failed` | LAN client flow | Same-Wi-Fi diagnostics |
| `relay_host_attempt` / `relay_alloc_succeeded` / `relay_alloc_failed` | Unity Relay allocation | Internet-mode allocation failures |
| `relay_host_ready` / `relay_host_voice_failed` | Host pipeline complete | Voice room property set after Relay alloc |
| `relay_join_attempt` / `relay_join_voice_timeout` / `relay_join_property_missing` / `relay_join_calling` / `relay_join_succeeded` / `relay_join_failed` | Internet client flow | Specific failure points along Relay join |
| `voice_connect_attempt` | VoiceBootstrap.Start() | Photon Voice cloud connection start |
| `voice_state` | Photon `ClientState` transitions | Connection state debugging |
| `voice_joined` / `voice_left_room` / `voice_disconnected_while_in_room` / `voice_room_join_attempt` / `voice_room_leave_requested` | Voice room lifecycle | Voice room name + timing |
| `client_connected` / `client_disconnected` | NGO callbacks | NetworkManager-level peer presence |
| `stop_pressed` / `stopped` | Editor X key | Graceful shutdown trace |
| `unity_error` | Any Unity `LogError` / `LogException` / `Assert` | Crash and error capture |
| `app_quit` | OnApplicationQuit | End-of-session marker |
| `MANUAL_MARKER` | Editor `L` key (or `DebugLogger.Marker()` from any script) | "We said now" — synchronise both logs |

Each event is one JSON line:

```json
{"ts":"2026-05-16T14:07:32.118","mono":12.473,"event":"relay_join_attempt","room":"A"}
{"ts":"2026-05-16T14:07:32.345","mono":12.700,"event":"voice_room_join_attempt","room":"A"}
{"ts":"2026-05-16T14:07:33.892","mono":14.247,"event":"voice_joined","room":"A"}
{"ts":"2026-05-16T14:07:34.011","mono":14.366,"event":"relay_join_calling"}
{"ts":"2026-05-16T14:07:35.482","mono":15.837,"event":"client_connected","id":0,"role":"client"}
{"ts":"2026-05-16T14:07:35.483","mono":15.838,"event":"relay_join_succeeded"}
```

Fields:

- `ts` — local wall-clock time, `yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:ss.fff`
- `mono` — `Time.realtimeSinceStartup`, seconds with millisecond precision (monotonic, immune to wall-clock drift)
- `event` — short snake_case name from the table above
- `msg` — optional free-text description
- everything else — per-event key/value details (`room`, `mode`, `id`, etc.)

## Where logs are stored

On the headset:

```
/sdcard/Android/data/com.unitymcplab.campfireroom/files/debug-logs/
```

In the Editor (Mac):

```
~/Library/Application Support/unity-mcp-lab/CampfireVR/debug-logs/
```

Filename format: `campfirevr-log-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.jsonl` (one file per app launch, timestamp = first start). Each file rotates at **5 MB**; the **10 most-recent** files are kept and older ones are deleted automatically — no manual cleanup needed.

## Pulling logs from a Quest

Plug the Quest into your computer via USB-C, accept the Allow USB debugging popup if needed (see [install-on-quest.md](install-on-quest.md) Part A).

### Pull all logs from one headset

```sh
adb=/Applications/Unity/Hub/Editor/6000.4.7f1/PlaybackEngines/AndroidPlayer/SDK/platform-tools/adb
$adb pull /sdcard/Android/data/com.unitymcplab.campfireroom/files/debug-logs/ ./quest-logs/
```

(Use plain `adb` if you have Android Platform Tools on your `PATH`.)

This copies every log file into `./quest-logs/` on your computer. About 5–50 KB per session.

### Pull only the most recent session

```sh
$adb shell ls -t /sdcard/Android/data/com.unitymcplab.campfireroom/files/debug-logs/ | head -1
# → campfirevr-log-20260516-140728.jsonl

$adb pull /sdcard/Android/data/com.unitymcplab.campfireroom/files/debug-logs/campfirevr-log-20260516-140728.jsonl ./
```

### Pull from both headsets in one session

If both Quests are plugged into the same machine at once (rare — usually one cable, one headset):

```sh
$adb devices
# List of devices attached
# 2G0YC5ZG20031Y    device
# 1WMHHA4242C123     device

$adb -s 2G0YC5ZG20031Y pull /sdcard/Android/data/com.unitymcplab.campfireroom/files/debug-logs/ ./johan-logs/
$adb -s 1WMHHA4242C123  pull /sdcard/Android/data/com.unitymcplab.campfireroom/files/debug-logs/ ./friend-logs/
```

More usually, each tester pulls their own headset's logs and shares the file:

```sh
$adb pull /sdcard/Android/data/com.unitymcplab.campfireroom/files/debug-logs/$(adb shell ls -t /sdcard/Android/data/com.unitymcplab.campfireroom/files/debug-logs/ | head -1) ./mine.jsonl
# Send mine.jsonl over Discord / email / however you communicate.
```

### Naming convention for shared logs

When sharing across testers, **rename the file** before sending so the receiver can tell whose log it is:

```
campfirevr-log-20260516-140728.jsonl    →    johan-20260516-140728.jsonl
campfirevr-log-20260516-140730.jsonl    →    friend-20260516-140730.jsonl
```

Keep the timestamp portion — it makes timeline reconstruction trivial.

## Comparing two logs

Both files are JSONL. To eyeball them, just open in an editor side by side. To do something more programmatic:

```sh
# Pretty-print one log to terminal
cat johan-20260516-140728.jsonl | jq -c '. | {ts, event, msg}'

# Interleave two logs chronologically by ts
{ sed 's/^/[johan] /' johan-20260516-140728.jsonl;
  sed 's/^/[friend] /' friend-20260516-140730.jsonl; } |
  sort -k2 |
  head -40

# Find when a specific event happened on each side
grep relay_join_succeeded johan-20260516-140728.jsonl
grep relay_join_succeeded friend-20260516-140730.jsonl
```

The `mono` field is the monotonic seconds since each app's own start — useful for "how long after I pressed B did it actually connect?" The `ts` field is wall-clock — useful for matching up across two devices that may have different uptimes.

## Manual markers

When you and your friend hit a moment worth flagging ("voice cut out **now**"), pressing the `L` key in the Editor writes a `MANUAL_MARKER` event:

```json
{"ts":"2026-05-16T14:08:12.992","mono":53.347,"event":"MANUAL_MARKER","msg":"editor_L"}
```

In headset there's currently no button bound to `Marker()` — the in-VR controls (X / B / Y / A / stick) are all in use by host/join/mode/recenter/room. A future polish slice can add a long-press combo for an in-headset marker if the test workflow needs it.

To insert a marker programmatically from anywhere in code:

```csharp
DebugLogger.Marker("voice-cut-out");
```

## What to send back for debugging

When something fails during a test session, share these along with the report:

1. **Both log files** (renamed per the convention above), covering the failing session.
2. **The wall-clock time** the failure happened (so we know which log entries to focus on).
3. **One sentence** describing what each side saw on screen at that moment.
4. **`adb logcat -d > friend-logcat.txt`** output from the headset that failed (catches native crashes the in-app logger never sees).

That's enough information to reconstruct most multiplayer failures without needing a re-test.

## Privacy and storage notes

- **No PII.** The logger captures device model and OS-level device name (e.g. "Quest 3", "Johan's Quest") plus event timing. No voice audio, no chat content, no IP addresses, no Photon room properties beyond names like "A".
- **No cloud upload.** Files stay on the headset until you pull them via adb. There's no analytics service or external reporting endpoint.
- **No frame-rate impact.** The logger writes one JSON line per discrete event (~50–200 events per session). It's not hooked into `Update()` — only state-change detection and explicit `DebugLogger.Log()` calls.
- **File rotation.** 5 MB per file, 10 files kept, older ones auto-deleted. A heavy week of testing won't fill the Quest's storage.

## Disabling

The logger is always on for the current sideload builds — there's no "production build" yet. If you ever want to turn it off in a specific build:

1. Add a `DEBUG_LOGGING` scripting define symbol in Player Settings → Other Settings → Scripting Define Symbols.
2. Wrap the body of `DebugLogger.WriteInternal` in `#if DEBUG_LOGGING ... #endif`, default off.
3. Strip it from release builds only — keep dev/sideload builds with it on.

Not implemented yet because we're never doing release builds in the current MVP. Worth doing if the project ever ships to the Meta Quest Store.
