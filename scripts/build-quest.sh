# scripts/build-quest.sh — local Quest APK build + optional deploy.
#
# Wraps `Tools → Quest Setup → Build Remote Fika APK` (= QuestBuildAPK.Build)
# in a Unity batchmode invocation, so iteration doesn't require opening the
# Editor and clicking Cmd+B. With --install / --launch, chains adb on a
# USB-connected Quest.
#
# Usage:
#   ./scripts/build-quest.sh                            # build only
#   ./scripts/build-quest.sh --install                  # build + adb install -r
#   ./scripts/build-quest.sh --launch                   # build + install + monkey-launch
#   ./scripts/build-quest.sh --install-only             # skip build, install existing APK
#   ./scripts/build-quest.sh --install-only --launch    # skip build, install + launch
#   ./scripts/build-quest.sh --help
#
# Requirements:
#   * Unity ${UNITY_VERSION} (set via env if you upgrade) installed under
#     /Applications/Unity/Hub/Editor/<version>/Unity.app
#   * Unity Editor must NOT have CampfireVR open in another window — Unity
#     can't acquire the project lock from batchmode if the GUI is editing
#     the same project. Close the Editor first, or use a separate Unity
#     instance for batch builds.
#   * For --install / --launch: Quest connected via USB-C with Developer
#     Mode enabled. Run `adb devices` once first time to authorise.
#
# Exit codes:
#   0 — success
#   1 — bad CLI args
#   2 — Unity / project not found
#   3 — Unity ran but no APK produced (check the log Unity wrote to stdout)
#   4 — adb not found (only when --install / --launch was requested)

Usage: $(basename "$0") [--install] [--launch] [--install-only] [--help]

Builds CampfireVR APK via Unity batchmode. Wraps
Tools/Quest Setup/Build Remote Fika APK from QuestBuildAPK.cs.

Options:
  --install        adb install -r the built APK onto the first connected Quest
  --launch         adb monkey-launch the app after install (implies --install)
  --install-only   skip the Unity build; install the existing APK at the
                   configured output path. Combine with --launch to also boot
                   the app. Fails if no APK has been built yet.
  -h, --help       show this message

Env:
  UNITY_VERSION   Unity Editor version (default: 6000.4.7f1)
