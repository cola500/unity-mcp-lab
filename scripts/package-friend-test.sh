# scripts/package-friend-test.sh — bundle a tested APK + docs into an
# immutable, traceable friend test zip.
#
# Replaces the manual "## 4. Create the friend package" recipe in
# docs/release-process.md. Reads UnityProject/Assets/Resources/build-info.json
# (written by scripts/build-quest.sh at build time) to pick the APK and to
# stamp the zip filename with the exact build version + timestamp, so two
# different builds can never collide on the same zip name.
#
# Artifact policy:
#   - Versioned APKs (Builds/CampfireVR-v<ver>-<YYYYMMDD-HHMM>.apk) are
#     IMMUTABLE — already named by build-quest.sh, never overwritten.
#   - Builds/CampfireVR-latest.apk is an overwriteable convenience pointer.
#     Do not ship it directly; use the versioned filename it currently
#     points at.
#   - dist/friend-test/ is a transient STAGING folder — we recreate it
#     every run. Don't archive it; it's not the release artifact.
#   - dist/CampfireVR-friend-test-<version>-<YYYYMMDD-HHMM>.zip is the
#     release artifact. Immutable: the script refuses to overwrite an
#     existing zip with the same name (use --force only when you really
#     mean it).
#
# Usage:
#   ./scripts/package-friend-test.sh                # use newest APK matching BUILD-INFO
#   ./scripts/package-friend-test.sh --apk PATH     # package a specific APK instead
#   ./scripts/package-friend-test.sh --force        # overwrite an existing zip
#   ./scripts/package-friend-test.sh --no-sha256    # skip SHA256 generation
#   ./scripts/package-friend-test.sh --help
#
# The default flow:
#   1. Read UnityProject/Assets/Resources/build-info.json.
#   2. Resolve the APK named in build-info.apkName under UnityProject/Builds/.
#   3. Refuse if BUILD-INFO says the tree was dirty unless --allow-dirty.
#      (A dirty build can't be reliably reproduced from the recorded commit;
#      shipping it makes future bug reports ambiguous.)
#   4. Stage dist/friend-test/ with APK + INSTALL.md + DEBUG-LOGS.md +
#      CHANGELOG.md + BUILD-INFO.json + RELEASE-NOTES.md + README.md +
#      SHA256SUMS.
#   5. Zip → dist/CampfireVR-friend-test-<version>-<YYYYMMDD-HHMM>.zip
#   6. Sidecar .sha256 of the zip itself for download-integrity check.
#
# Exit codes:
#   0 — success
#   1 — bad CLI args
#   2 — BUILD-INFO.json or APK not found
#   3 — output zip already exists (use --force to override)
#   4 — build is dirty (use --allow-dirty if you really mean it)

Packages the APK named in BUILD-INFO.json into an immutable friend test zip
under dist/, alongside install / debug / changelog docs and a generated
RELEASE-NOTES.md.

Options:
  --apk PATH       Package a specific APK instead of the one named in
                   BUILD-INFO.json. Useful for re-packaging an older
                   versioned build.
  --force          Overwrite an existing zip with the same name. Default
                   is to refuse (immutability is the point).
  --no-sha256      Skip SHA256 generation. Default is to include
                   SHA256SUMS inside the zip and a sidecar .sha256 next
                   to the zip.
  --allow-dirty    Allow packaging a build whose BUILD-INFO records
                   gitDirty=true. Default is to refuse — uncommitted
                   changes can't be reliably reconstructed from the
                   recorded commit.

# CampfireVR — friend test build

Thanks for testing! This zip has everything you need to install CampfireVR on your Meta Quest 3 and join a remote campfire session.

**This build:** \`${VERSION}\` · built ${BUILD_TIME} · commit ${GIT_COMMIT}${DIRTY_NOTE}
See \`RELEASE-NOTES.md\` for a one-page summary and \`CHANGELOG.md\` for the full per-version history.

## What's in here

| File | What it is |
|---|---|
| \`${APK_NAME}\` | The app — sideloads onto your Quest. ~${APK_SIZE_MB}. |
| \`INSTALL.md\` | Full step-by-step install guide. Read this first if you've never sideloaded a Quest app. |
| \`DEBUG-LOGS.md\` | How to pull session logs off the headset if something goes wrong. |
| \`RELEASE-NOTES.md\` | One-page summary of this specific build. |
| \`CHANGELOG.md\` | Full version history. |
| \`BUILD-INFO.json\` | Build identity (version, timestamp, git commit) — same info baked into the APK. |
| \`SHA256SUMS\` | Checksums for the APK so you can verify the download is intact. |
| \`README.md\` | This file. |

## Install — quickest path

**If you have Meta Quest Developer Hub (recommended, no terminal):**

1. Download MQDH: <https://developer.oculus.com/downloads/package/oculus-developer-hub-mac/> (or Windows / Linux equivalent).
2. Sign in with the Meta account paired to your Quest.
3. Make sure Developer Mode is enabled on your Quest (one-time setup — see \`INSTALL.md\` Part A if not).
4. Plug the Quest in via USB-C.
5. Drag \`${APK_NAME}\` onto your headset in MQDH's sidebar. Done.

**If you prefer adb (terminal):**

\`\`\`sh
adb install -r ${APK_NAME}
\`\`\`

If \`adb devices\` shows nothing, see \`INSTALL.md\` troubleshooting section.

## Find and launch the app

Inside the headset:

1. From the home menu → **Apps** (bottom row).
2. Top-right dropdown → **Unknown Sources** — sideloaded apps live here, hidden by default. (Not a bug; this is how Meta hides non-store apps.)
3. Click **CampfireVR**. First launch takes ~10 seconds.

## First minute in headset

You'll see a campfire at night, two stone seats, a forest, a dog by one of the seats, and a world-space text panel that reads \`Room: A\`.

- **To host:** press **left X** on your controller. Tell me "we're on A" — that's the default room.
- **To join:** press **right B** when I say I'm hosting.
- **Use Internet mode** unless we're on the same Wi-Fi. The bottom of the panel should read \`mode · Internet\` — if it says \`Same Wi-Fi\`, press **left Y** to toggle. (Same Wi-Fi mode is dev-only in this build; it won't work for two people in different houses.)
- **Headphones strongly recommended.** Quest speakers leak voice into the other Quest's microphone — voice gets weird without them.
- **Other controls:** A = recenter, right thumbstick = cycle the room letter (only needed if multiple pairs are testing at once).

## If the session gets weird (stop / recovery)

This build has an in-VR recovery path so you don't have to quit the app and start over:

- **Long-press left Y for ~1.5 seconds** → cleanly stops the current session (voice + Relay + networking shutdown). Room letter + mode are preserved. After the stop you can press X to re-host or B to re-join.
- **Short tap left Y** still toggles between Internet and Same Wi-Fi mode (unchanged from before).

If you ever feel like the connection is half-stuck, that's the move — long-press Y, wait a second for the panel to say \`Ready\`, then host or join again.

## If something fails

Please send me the debug logs — they tell me exactly what happened during your session (when you tried to join, what state networking was in, whether voice connected, etc).

Quick recipe (run on your computer with the Quest connected via USB-C):

\`\`\`sh
adb pull /sdcard/Android/data/com.unitymcplab.campfireroom/files/debug-logs ~/Desktop/campfirevr-logs
\`\`\`

Then zip that folder and send it to me. Full instructions in \`DEBUG-LOGS.md\`, including a manual pull recipe if \`adb\` isn't on your machine.

When you report a bug, mentioning the APK filename (\`${APK_NAME}\`) or just the commit (\`${GIT_COMMIT}\`) tells me exactly which build to look at — but the logs already include this so don't worry if you forget.

## Verifying the download (optional)

If you want to be sure the APK isn't corrupted, the included \`SHA256SUMS\` file has the expected hash. Verify with:

\`\`\`sh
shasum -a 256 -c SHA256SUMS
# Expected output:
#   ${APK_NAME}: OK
\`\`\`
