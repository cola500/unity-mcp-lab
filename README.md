# unity-mcp-lab

A cozy social VR experiment for Meta Quest 3, built entirely as thin vertical slices through Claude Code driving the Unity Editor over MCP.

## Vision

Two people meet in VR, sit by a low-poly campfire, and talk. Nothing more.

The repo starts as the AI ↔ Editor link and grows one verifiable slice at a time toward that goal — Quest 3 standalone, seated, low-poly, cozy. See [docs/vision.md](docs/vision.md) for the longer version.

## Current MVP

`CampfireRoom` scene running standalone on Quest 3:

- Night-time campfire room (ground, logs, flickering flame, point-light glow, dark navy ambient).
- Seated player rig at `PlayerSlot_A` facing the fire, with explicit camera offset for sitting eye height.
- Head tracking via HMD, hand placeholders via tracked Quest controllers, trigger feedback.
- A second placeholder slot (`PlayerSlot_B`) that subtly looks at the fire.
- Minimal LAN multiplayer spike that synchronises a remote player's head pose between two Quests (or Quest + Editor).

No voice, no hands-on-network, no locomotion, no interactions. Every piece is a separate slice.

## Verified capabilities

- [x] Unity Editor controlled by Claude Code via [`CoderGamester/mcp-unity`](https://github.com/CoderGamester/mcp-unity)
- [x] Scene authoring through MCP (primitives, materials, lighting, scripts, components, prefabs, build settings)
- [x] Quest 3 standalone build via Oculus XR Plugin
- [x] HMD pose tracking with a hand-written `XRHeadTracker` (no XRI/Input System)
- [x] Hand/controller presence as primitive placeholders tracking `XRNode.LeftHand` / `RightHand`
- [x] Trigger input feedback (subtle scale pulse on the hand placeholder)
- [x] Netcode for GameObjects on UnityTransport, owner-authoritative head pose sync over LAN

Networking model: each peer spawns a `PlayerHead` prefab on connect. Owner-authoritative `ClientNetworkTransform` syncs head pose. Owner hides its own visual (we render through `VRCamera`).

## Quest 3 setup

**One-time:**

1. Unity Hub → Installs → Add Modules → **Android Build Support** with **OpenJDK** and **Android SDK & NDK Tools**.
2. `sudo softwareupdate --install-rosetta --agree-to-license` (Unity's toolchain needs it even on arm64).
3. Quest: Developer Mode on via the Meta Quest mobile app; allow USB debugging on first connect.
4. Open the project in Unity, run **Tools → Quest Setup → Configure Project for Quest 3** once.

**Each iteration:**

```
adb=/Applications/Unity/Hub/Editor/6000.4.7f1/PlaybackEngines/AndroidPlayer/SDK/platform-tools/adb
$adb devices                          # expect your Quest serial
# In Unity:
# File → Build Settings → Build And Run   (or Cmd+B)
```

The APK installs and launches automatically. Falling back to flat-screen Editor view: enable `Main Camera` and disable `VRRig`.

## Multiplayer testing

Scene has `NetworkManager` (NGO + UnityTransport), `NetworkBootstrap`, and `ServicesBootstrap`. The bootstrap supports two modes:

| Mode | Use | How to start |
|---|---|---|
| **LAN** | same Wi-Fi / same machine | direct IP — set `serverAddress` in the scene before building |
| **Relay** | two devices on different internet connections | Unity Relay free tier; short join code shared out of band |

Toggle with **M** in the Editor (the on-screen `Mode:` label flips). Default is **LAN**.

| Action | Editor (Mac) | Quest |
|---|---|---|
| Toggle Mode | **M** | left controller **X** |
| Start as host | **H** | right controller **A** |
| Start as client | **C** | right controller **B** |
| Stop | **X** | left controller **Y** |

**LAN flow:** read the host's IP from its overlay, set that as `serverAddress` on the client build, rebuild, deploy.

**Relay flow:**

1. On host (Quest): press **left X** to switch to Relay. Press **right A** to host. The overlay shows a large cozy `CAMPFIRE CODE` with the 6 characters spaced apart and a gentle warm pulse. State line below reads `Waiting for friend…`.
2. Share the 6-character code out of band (SMS, Discord) to the remote person.
3. On client (Quest): press **left X** to switch to Relay. Press **right B** to join. With no code entered yet, this opens Quest's system keyboard with the prompt "Campfire code"; type the 6 characters and confirm. The state line walks `Enter the campfire code… → Connecting to ABCDEF… → Connected`.
4. On the host, the state flips to `Friend joined the fire`. Head, hands, and presence breathing sync over Relay exactly as on LAN.
5. **Stop**: press **left Y** on either side. Disconnects gracefully and clears the entered code.

In the Editor, the same actions are bound to **M** / **H** / **C** / **X**; an extra "Join code (editor):" text field is shown so you can type without the system keyboard.

Unity Dashboard prerequisites: Authentication and Relay services must be Active for the project's `cloudProjectId`. Anonymous sign-in is automatic; no UI.

**Ambient fire crackle:** `Assets/audio/campfire_crackle.wav` is played by an `AudioSource` on the `FireCrackleAudio` GameObject parented to `Flame`. Looping, `spatialBlend = 1`, linear rolloff 0.5–8 m, volume 0.4 — under conversation, present in silence. The clip is yours to drop in (see `Tools → Ambience Setup → Create FireCrackleAudio` for the re-runnable wiring).

**Voice chat (spatial, from across the fire):** Photon Voice 2 is imported under `Assets/Photon/`. `VoiceBootstrap` connects to Photon Cloud at startup; after Host/Client succeeds via the regular campfire flow, it auto-joins a Photon Voice room whose name equals the Relay join code (or `lan-campfire` on LAN). A `Recorder` on `NetworkBootstrap` captures the local mic; remote voices are played by Speakers auto-instantiated from `Assets/Prefabs/VoiceSpeaker.prefab`. A tiny `VoiceSpeakerPlacer` reparents each spawned Speaker under `RemoteRig` at eye height, with `AudioSource.spatialBlend = 1` and linear rolloff 0.5–10 m, so the friend's voice comes from their seat across the fire. The overlay walks `Voice: connecting… → Voice connected (CODE) → Voice: left room`. No mute button — see [docs/voice-research.md](docs/voice-research.md) for what's next.

When it works: the static `PlayerSlot_B` placeholder disappears and the remote player's head appears anchored at the `RemoteRig` (mirror of `VRRig` across the fire), facing the campfire. The owner's head pose is broadcast in seat-relative coordinates so the remote always sits at their seat regardless of where the owner physically is. **Two small cubes** also appear at the remote's hand positions, driven by NGO `NetworkVariable<Vector3>` / `NetworkVariable<Quaternion>` pairs — same seat-relative transform applied to `LeftHandAnchor` / `RightHandAnchor`. On disconnect, `PlayerSlot_B` returns. No finger tracking, no IK, no voice.

## MCP workflow

The whole project was authored through Claude Code calling `mcp__mcp-unity__*` tools against a running Unity Editor. Notable patterns we settled on:

- **Re-runnable Editor menus** (`Tools → Quest Setup → ...`, `Tools → Network Setup → ...`) configure non-trivial setup (Player Settings, XR loader, NetworkManager bindings) declaratively. Easier than poking individual fields through MCP and reproducible from scratch.
- **`Assets/Refresh` is required** after writing a new `.cs` via MCP — `recompile_scripts` alone does not surface the new file to the asset database.
- **MCP cannot bind `UnityEngine.Object` references** through JSON `componentData`. Workarounds: auto-find by name in `OnEnable` (used in `FaceTarget`, `NetworkHead`), or wire references inside an Editor menu (`NetworkSetup`).
- **Verify with `get_console_logs`** after each compile-affecting change.
- **Restart Claude Code** after editing `.mcp.json` or starting the Unity-side MCP server.

## Known issues / limitations

- `.mcp.json` is gitignored. It embeds an absolute path and a `Library/PackageCache/com.gamelovers.mcp-unity@<HASH>/` segment; the hash changes on package upgrade. `.mcp.example.json` ships as a template.
- Hand placeholders sit on the controller grip tracking point, not the palm — they feel slightly offset.
- `serverAddress` is baked into the scene at build time. No runtime IP entry, no LAN discovery.
- No graceful Stop on Quest builds — re-launch the app to disconnect.
- ~~`PlayerSlot_B` and a remote `PlayerHead` can co-exist visually; not yet de-duplicated.~~ Resolved: remote head is anchored at `RemoteRig` and `PlayerSlot_B`'s mesh hides while occupied.
- Floor tracking origin alone was not enough on Quest 3; we use Device origin + an explicit `CameraOffset y=1.2`. See [docs/retro-log.md](docs/retro-log.md).

## Next slices

In rough order, each tiny enough to ship in one commit. Full list in [docs/roadmap.md](docs/roadmap.md):

1. Place the first remote `PlayerHead` at `PlayerSlot_B`'s position and hide the static placeholder when a remote peer connects.
2. Sync the hand anchors over the network too (same pattern as the head).
3. Voice chat (Vivox or peer-to-peer alternative).
4. Cozy polish — bloom on the flame, ambient crackle audio, dimmer global ambient.
